The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the **current conversion rate** is about **13%** on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an **increase of 2%**, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.\n",

    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you are not familiar with the above, all this really means is that whatever conversion rate we observe for our new design in our test, we want to be 95% confident it is statistically different from the conversion rate of our old design, before we decide to reject the Null hypothesis $H_0$.

    "This will be our *Independent Variable*. The reason we have two groups even though we know the baseline conversion rate is that we want to control for other variables that could have an effect on our results, such as seasonality: by having a `control` group we can directly compare their results to the `treatment` group, because the only systematic difference between the groups is the design of the product page, and we can therefore attribute any differences in results to the designs.\n",

    "For our *Dependent Variable* (i.e. what we are trying to measure), we are interested in capturing the `conversion rate`. A way we can code this is by  each user session with a binary variable:\n",

    "* **Power of the test** ($1 - \\beta$) - This represents the probability of finding a statistical difference between the groups in our test when a difference is actually present. This is usually set at 0.8 as a convention (here's more info on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test\">statistical power</a>, if you are curious)\n",
    "* **Alpha value** ($\\alpha$) - The critical value we set earlier to 0.05\n",
    "* **Effect size** - How big of a difference we expect there to be between the conversion rates\n",

    "Very often, one is overwhelmed by the large number of statistical tests that can be found on textbooks, which makes it hard to figure out which one should be chosen for a specific problem.\n",

    "What is of fundamental importance is **not** to memorize all possible statistical tests, but to **understanding the logic** behind them, which is the **same for all tests**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests try to answer the same question: *Is the apparent effect real, or is it due to chance?*  To answer that question, we formulate two hypotheses: the null hypothesis, $H_0$, is a model of the system if the effect is due to chance; the alternate hypothesis, $H_A$, is a model where the effect is real.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we should compute the probability of seeing the effect ($E$) under both hypotheses; that is $P(E | H_0)$ and $P(E | H_A)$.  But formulating $H_A$ is not always easy, so in conventional hypothesis testing, we just compute $P(E | H_0)$, which is the $p$-value.  If the $p$-value is small, we conclude that the effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance, which suggests that it is real.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's hypothesis testing.  All of the so-called statistical tests are just ways to compute $p$-values efficiently. When computation was expensive, shortcuts were needed. However, now that computation is virtually free, the alternative is to use **simulations**."

    "\n",
    "1. Given a dataset, you compute a **test statistic** that measures the size of the apparent effect.  For example, if you are describing a difference between two groups, the test statistic might be the absolute difference in means.  I'll call the test statistic from the observed data $\\delta^{*}$. It can be consider as an *unexpectedness score*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, you define a **null hypothesis**, which is a **model of the world** under the assumption that the effect is not real; for example, if you think there might be a difference between two groups, the null hypothesis would assume that there is no difference. The model should be stochastic, i.e. capable of generating random datasets similar to the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The goal of classical hypothesis testing is to compute a **$p$-value, which is the probability of seeing an effect as big as $\\delta^{*}$ under the null hypothesis**.  You can estimate the p-value by using your model of the null hypothesis to generate many simulated datasets.  For each simulated dataset, compute the same test statistic you used on the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, **count the fraction of times** the test statistic from simulated data exceeds  $\\delta^{*}$.  This fraction approximates the p-value.  If it's sufficiently small, you can conclude that the apparent effect is unlikely to be due to chance (if you don't believe that sentence, please read this).\n"
